## Daily process ## 🌞🌔🌛

- New roles rotated alphabetically : Ashlee → Euny → Mona → Taihua
- Pair program on assigned tasks
- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting.
- Bring up any blocking issues after 40 minutes of spinning your wheels
- At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into the main branch

## Team expectations

- Coding after hours is acceptable, but NOT expected. No pull requests to be approved after hours.
- Weekends will be up for discussion closers to the deadline.
- Utilizing the slack for questions is acceptable.
- We will listen to eachother and not interrupt
- Communication is wide open, and we will share what we're working on regularly.
- At least message the group when you change what you are working on

## Issues

- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
  - Explain why they think their approach is best
  - List out the pros / cons
  - Take 10-15 minute break
  - Vote on it
  - If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor

## If you are frustrated

- Talk about it with the group.
- Take a walk or get some water
- Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
- Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
